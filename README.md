This is a trick(code) to get the number which you had choosen at initially.
Initially you need to press 's' to start the game(run the code and press s),then after it dispalys some numbers along with the row number, here you need to choose the number and keep it secreat,agan the numbers are dispalyed for 3 times and you need to tell the row number where ypur secrect number is laying by giving the row number.At last it displays your secreat number what you had choosen initially.
NOTE:-Dont change your initiall secreat number up to last.
